# Flowlean Automation

**More Shopify sales without adding headcount.**  
I build **Ops Systems** for Shopify DTC brands doing **$20k+/mo+**.

## Outcomes
- **Revenue Recovery:** abandoned checkout + failed payments → automated sequences
- **Inventory Control:** stockout prevention + replenishment alerts
- **Support Ops:** faster replies + consistent post-purchase handling

## Delivery standard
- **7-day setup**
- Monitoring + error handling + rollback plan
- SOP + checklist (so the system runs without you)
